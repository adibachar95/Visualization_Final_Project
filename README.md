# Visualization Final Project

Impact NYC: Data-Driven Insights into Urban Traffic Safety 
Welcome to the NYC Traffic Accident Analysis project. This repository explores the "City That Never Sleeps" through the lens of urban safety, using data-driven storytelling to identify high-risk patterns on New York streets.

This project was developed as part of the Information Visualization course at Ben-Gurion University.

Project Abstract 
This project analyzes a decade of NYC collision data (2013-2023) to uncover spatial, temporal, and causal risk factors.

The Report: Provides a deep academic dive into 6 key visualizations, discussing methodology, visual encoding, and critical safety conclusions.

The Notebook: A full End-to-End Data Science pipeline. It features robust Feature Engineering (standardizing hundreds of raw inputs into 9 macro-categories) and interactive visualizations using Plotly and Folium.

Repository Contents 
Final Project Report - Detailed academic documentation of our findings and methodology.

Visual Analysis: The 6 Pillars 
1. A Rare Bright Side of COVID-19 A Line Chart tracking monthly trends over 10 years. It highlights the dramatic impact of the 2020 lockdowns on traffic volume across all five boroughs.
2. The Clock of Danger A Heatmap correlating days of the week and hours of the day. It reveals that while rush hours are busy, Saturday nights are the deadliest, with a higher ratio of fatal outcomes.
3. Road Roulette: Interactive Danger Map - An interactive Folium map utilizing Marker Clustering. It allows users to explore "Hotspots" of severe accidents and drill down into street-level crash details.
4. A Forest of Steel: Vehicle Type Distribution - A Treemap visualizing the hierarchy of involved vehicles. It showcases the dominance of private vehicles in the urban crash landscape after intensive data cleaning and categorization.
5. Small Vehicle, Big Consequences - A 100% Stacked Bar Chart that neutralizes volume bias. It uncovers the extreme vulnerability of two-wheeled vehicles (motorcycles/bikes), where almost every collision results in injury or fatality.
6. If You Don't Want to Kill, Don't Text and Drive - A hard-hitting Bar Chart focusing exclusively on fatalities. It identifies driver inattention and digital distraction as the leading "killers" on NYC roads.
